## Project Baseline Summary
- Project name: AI-LungCare
- Project goal: Develop an AI-assisted system that helps detect/identify lung-related conditions from medical data (e.g., X-ray images) and present results in a clear way for clinic staff.
- Planned duration: 12 weeks
- Planned budget: RM 6,000 (data preparation + software tools + testing resources)

### Scope Baseline (What we will deliver)
- A working AI model (training + evaluation results)
- A simple interface/prototype to upload input and show prediction results
- Documentation (report, user guide, and final presentation/demo)
- Basic privacy/security handling (limited access + safe storage approach)

### Key Milestones
- M1: Project initiation + stakeholder approval (Week 2)
- M2: Dataset collection + preprocessing completed (Week 5)
- M3: Model training + evaluation results produced (Week 8)
- M4: System integration + testing (Week 10)
- M5: Final report + presentation/demo submission (Week 12)

### Baseline Assumptions / Constraints
- Dataset access is available on time and has acceptable quality.
- Team members contribute weekly based on assigned roles (PM, AI team, documentation).
- Model performance target: stable and explainable results (not only high accuracy).
- Risks: data quality issues, limited time, and hardware/compute limitations.
