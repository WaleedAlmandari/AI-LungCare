## Project Baseline Summary

**Planned duration:**  
Based on our Week 05 baseline schedule, AI-LungCare is planned across **9 project weeks (Week 1 → Week 9)**. The work is arranged in clear phases: we first prepare and verify the dataset, then build and train the CNN model, then integrate the model into a backend API, followed by UI prototype + system testing, and finally documentation and submission.

**Planned budget:**  
From the Week 05 Cost & Resource Plan, the planned total budget is **approximately RM 785**. Most of the cost is concentrated in the technical work (data preparation, model development/training, and backend integration). Documentation and ethics-related tasks are low cost because they mainly require writing and review rather than tools or compute.

**Key milestones:**  
- **Data preparation completed** (verified datasets + cleaned data) — **End of Week 2**  
- **Model design & training finished** (CNN trained and saved as **v1**) — **End of Week 4**  
- **Backend API integration completed** (Flask API working and returning predictions) — **End of Week 6**  
- **Supervisor approval / readiness check** (system stable for demo) — **End of Week 7**  
- **Final submission** (final report, slides, and GitHub release **v1.0**) — **End of Week 9**
