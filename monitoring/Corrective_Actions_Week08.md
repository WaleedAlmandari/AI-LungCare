# Corrective Actions – Week 08
Project: AI-LungCare

## Corrective Action 1: Scope refinement (MVP first, then Phase 2)
- Action: Focus first on the core MVP: pneumonia detection using chest X-ray (CNN) + one working dashboard flow (upload → prediction → result).
- Move to Phase 2: lung cancer dataset, cough sound dataset, Random Forest model, GPT analyzer, and chatbot.
- Why: The scope includes multiple datasets and multiple AI tools, which increases workload and risk if done all at once.
- Expected outcome: A stable core system is completed on time, and extra features are still planned clearly for later.

## Corrective Action 2: Resource reallocation + improved communication
- Action: Reassign 1–2 members to focus only on the main blocker (data preprocessing + model validation), while the other member works on dashboard/API integration.
- Add short check-ins (10–15 minutes) twice per week to track progress and unblock issues quickly.
- Why: Data quality affects model accuracy, and model output affects integration—so dividing work and improving communication reduces delays.
- Expected outcome: Faster completion of CNN results + smoother integration, with fewer last-minute problems before reporting.
