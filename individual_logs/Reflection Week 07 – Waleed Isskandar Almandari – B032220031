## 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?

Effective communication reduces project risks by ensuring that all stakeholders clearly understand the project goals, scope, and responsibilities. When updates and issues are shared early, potential problems such as misunderstandings or delays can be identified and addressed before they become serious risks. This helps the project stay on track and supports better decision-making.

## 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?

The most critical stakeholder is the **Clinic Owner / Management** because they have the highest influence over whether the system is adopted and deployed. Their decisions affect budgeting, system usage, and long-term sustainability. Without their approval and support, the project would not succeed in a real clinic environment.
