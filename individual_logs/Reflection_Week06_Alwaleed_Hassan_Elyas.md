## Reflection Week 06 – Alwaleed Hassan Elyas

## What was the most challenging part of this week’s work?

The hardest part was identifying the risks properly and deciding which ones were actually serious for our project. At first, everything looked like a risk, but when I started ranking them by likelihood and impact, the real problems became clearer. It took time to think realistically, not just guess.

## How did your team communicate and support each other?

We shared our progress on Teams and discussed the risks together. Some team members pointed out issues I didn’t notice, like the chance of missing data or delays in model training. Using GitHub also helped because everyone could see the updated documents and comment quickly. It made the work faster and more organised.

## What will you improve next week?

Next week, I plan to refine the top-priority risks and link them more clearly to our project schedule. I also want to update the checklist again after we start the next development tasks, just to make sure everything stays aligned.
