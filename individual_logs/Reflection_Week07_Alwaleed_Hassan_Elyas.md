## 1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?

Effective communication helps reduce project risks by keeping all stakeholders informed about project progress and changes. When communication is clear and consistent, misunderstandings are reduced and problems can be discussed early. This allows the project team to respond quickly to issues and avoid unexpected delays.

## 2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?

The most critical stakeholder is the **Project Manager / Product Owner** because they coordinate between different stakeholders and ensure the project stays within scope, schedule, and budget. Their role is essential for managing risks, resolving conflicts, and keeping the project organized.
