1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?

Effective communication reduces project risks by making sure that all stakeholders clearly understand the project goals, scope, and responsibilities. When updates and issues are shared early, potential problems such as misunderstandings, delays, or incorrect assumptions can be addressed before they become serious risks. This also helps ensure that decisions are made on time and based on accurate information.

2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?

The most critical stakeholder is the Clinic Owner / Management because they have the highest influence over whether the system is adopted and deployed. Their decisions affect budgeting, system usage, and long-term sustainability. Without their approval and support, the project would not be successfully implemented in a real clinic environment.
