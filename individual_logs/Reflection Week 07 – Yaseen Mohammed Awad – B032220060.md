1. How does effective communication reduce project risks?

Effective communication helps reduce project risks by keeping everyone aligned and informed throughout the project. Regular communication allows the team to share progress, clarify requirements, and quickly respond to issues. This reduces the chance of errors, misaligned expectations, and last-minute changes that could negatively impact the project.

2. Which stakeholder is most critical to your project’s success and why?

The most critical stakeholder is the Doctors / Medical Staff because they are the primary users of the system. Their trust in the AI outputs and their willingness to use the system correctly directly impact the effectiveness and value of the project. If they do not understand or accept the system, the project will not achieve its intended goals.
